## 🎛️ Feature Flag Configuration

### Theme Toggle Flags

```typescript
interface ThemeFlags {
  // Main theme switch
  jungleAdventureTheme: boolean;

  // Route-specific flags
  jungleLogin: boolean;
  jungleAppHome: boolean;
  jungleAdmin: boolean; // Controlled exception
  jungleDemos: boolean;

  // Feature-specific flags
  jungleAnimations: boolean;
  jungleParallax: boolean;
  junglePatterns: boolean;

  // Performance flags
  reducedMotionOverride: boolean;
  saveDataOptimization: boolean;
}
```

### Rollout Configuration

```typescript
const rolloutConfig = {
  // Phase 3: Canary (10%)
  canary: {
    percentage: 10,
    targetRoutes: ["/login", "/app"],
    userSegments: ["beta_testers", "internal_users"],
    duration: "2 weeks",
  },

  // Phase 4: Gradual (50% then 100%)
  gradual: {
    phase1: { percentage: 50, duration: "1 week" },
    phase2: { percentage: 100, duration: "1 week" },
  },

  // Emergency rollback
  rollback: {
    trigger: "manual | automated",
    conditions: {
      errorRateThreshold: 1.0, // 1% error rate
      performanceRegression: 20, // 20% slower Core Web Vitals
      accessibilityScore: 95, // Below 95% accessibility
    },
  },
};
```

## 📊 Monitoring & Analytics

### Performance Metrics

```typescript
interface PerformanceKPIs {
  // Core Web Vitals
  lcp: number; // Target: < 2.5s
  fid: number; // Target: < 100ms
  cls: number; // Target: < 0.1
  inp: number; // Target: < 200ms

  // Custom metrics
  themeLoadTime: number;
  componentRenderTime: number;
  animationFrameRate: number;
  bundleLoadTime: number;
}
```

### User Experience Metrics

```typescript
interface UXMetrics {
  // Engagement
  sessionDuration: number;
  pageViewsPerSession: number;
  bounceRate: number;
  taskCompletionRate: number;

  // Accessibility
  screenReaderUsage: number;
  keyboardNavigationRate: number;
  reducedMotionPreference: number;
  saveDataUsage: number;

  // Errors & Issues
  javascriptErrorRate: number;
  consoleErrorCount: number;
  userReportedIssues: number;
  supportTicketVolume: number;
}
```

### Alert Thresholds

- **Critical**: Error rate > 1%, LCP > 4s, CLS > 0.25
- **Warning**: Error rate > 0.5%, LCP > 3s, CLS > 0.15
- **Info**: Performance improvement opportunities

## 🚨 Rollback Strategy

### Automatic Rollback Triggers

1. **Performance Regression**: Core Web Vitals degrade > 20%
2. **Error Spike**: JavaScript error rate > 1%
3. **Accessibility Failure**: Lighthouse accessibility score < 95
4. **User Experience**: Bounce rate increases > 15%

### Manual Rollback Process

1. **Immediate** (< 5 minutes): Feature flag disable
2. **Short-term** (< 30 minutes): Previous build deployment
3. **Investigation** (1-24 hours): Root cause analysis
4. **Resolution**: Fix, test, and gradual re-deployment

### Rollback Testing

```bash
# Test feature flag disable
npm run test:rollback:flags

# Test previous version deployment
npm run test:rollback:deployment

# Verify monitoring and alerting
npm run test:rollback:monitoring
```
