- Graceful degradation to simple navigation

## 🔧 **Performance Optimizations**

### Automatic Device Detection
```typescript
// Detects and optimizes for:
- Hardware concurrency (CPU cores)
- Available memory
- Screen size and pixel density
- Network connection speed
- User motion preferences
```

### Optimization Strategies
- **Asset Preloading**: Critical resources loaded based on device capability
- **Animation Throttling**: FPS monitoring with dynamic optimization

### Sound Effects
```typescript
const animalSounds = {
  owl: '/sounds/owl-hoot.mp3',
  parrot: '/sounds/parrot-chirp.mp3', 
  monkey: '/sounds/monkey-chatter.mp3',
  elephant: '/sounds/elephant-trumpet.mp3'
};
```

### Audio Features
