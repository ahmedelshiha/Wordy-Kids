This directory contains obsolete scripts, utilities, and automation tools.

## Script Categories

- `/build` - Deprecated build scripts
- `/migration` - One-time migration utilities

- `/utilities` - Deprecated helper scripts

## Archival Reasons

- Scripts replaced by newer versions

## Safety Notes

- Build scripts may contain important logic patterns
- Check git history before permanent deletion
