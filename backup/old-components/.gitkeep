# Old Components Backup

This directory contains retired React/Builder components that are no longer in active use.

## Naming Convention
Files should include timestamp suffix: component_YYYYMMDD.tsx

## Purpose
- Archive outdated components for reference
- Keep project clean while preserving development history
- Enable rollback if needed
