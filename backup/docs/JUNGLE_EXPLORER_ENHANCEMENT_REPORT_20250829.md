# Jungle Word Explorer – Analysis & Enhancement Report (2025-08-29)

## Overview

Goal: Elevate the Jungle Word Explorer for children by aligning with children’s UX research, improving accessibility, safety, and engagement, while keeping performance smooth across devices.

## Key Findings

- Missing age modes; identical UI for wide age range.
- Tap targets small in places; back button at bottom (risk of accidental taps).
- Limited explicit a11y (few aria labels, no live region); no reduced-motion support.
- Feedback present (sounds/vibration) but inconsistent verbal feedback.
- No parent-facing levers (session time, contrast).
- Navigation lacked swipe and robust keyboard support.

## What We Implemented

1. Age Modes & Readability

- Added ageGroup (3–5, 6–8, 9–12) selector with adaptive difficulty filtering and base font-size ≥ 18px.
- High-contrast toggle for visibility.

2. Interaction & Navigation

- Minimum 75×75px tap targets for core actions (pronounce, toggle definition, mastery, navigation, view toggles, audio).
- Removed bottom floating back button; retained safe top-back.
- Tap-to-flip on word display (Enter/Space accessible).
- Swipe navigation (touch) and Arrow key navigation (keyboard) for words.

3. Accessibility & Feedback

- ARIA labels, live region for announcements, container focusability.
- Reduced motion support honoring prefers-reduced-motion.
- Verbal announcements on category select, mastery, and favorites.

4. Parent Utilities

- Session timer surfaced in header.
- High-contrast toggle and clear audio labels.

## Files Changed

- client/components/JungleAdventureWordExplorer.tsx

## Research Alignment

- Age banding (NN/g 2-year bands): implemented 3–5, 6–8, 9–12.
- Large text & targets: base font-size ≥18px; 75×75px actions.
- Avoid bottom buttons: removed floating back.
- Immediate feedback: audio, haptics, live region announcements.
- Touch-first: swipe gestures; simple tap-to-flip pattern.
- Accessibility & inclusion: ARIA, reduced-motion, high contrast.
- Safety & parental needs: timers, visibility controls, minimal data.

## Next Recommendations

- Spaced repetition scheduling and “Due today” filter/badge.
- Phonetic overlays and syllable hints per age band.
- Offline-first caching of word assets and audio.
- Parent dashboard: progress over time, time limits, content filters.
- Calm animation presets and audit for over-animation.
- Content QA for cultural sensitivity and age-appropriateness.

## QA Checklist (Completed)

- [x] Keyboard: Arrow keys navigate; Enter/Space flip; focus trap safe.
- [x] Screen reader: live region updates; labeled controls.
- [x] Motion: respects prefers-reduced-motion.
- [x] Tap targets: key actions ≥75px on mobile.
- [x] Performance: no new heavy dependencies; minimal re-renders.

## Rollout Notes

- No breaking changes to external APIs.
- Persisted data still localStorage-only; COPPA-friendly by design.
