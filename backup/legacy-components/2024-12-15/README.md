# Legacy Components Archive - December 15, 2024

## Overview
This folder contains components that were replaced during the Jungle Word Library unification project. These components were moved to prevent duplication and simplify the codebase while implementing the new kid-first "funny game" model.

## Replaced Components

### Word Cards (Replaced by `WordCardUnified.tsx`)
- **EnhancedWordCard.tsx** - Enhanced word card with multiple features
- **JungleAdventureWordCard.tsx** - Jungle-themed word card
- **CategorySelector.tsx** - Basic category selection component
- **EnhancedCategorySelector.tsx** - Enhanced category selector with animations

### Navigation (Replaced by `ExplorerShell.tsx`)
- **JungleAdventureNav.tsx** - Original jungle navigation
- **JungleAdventureNavV3.tsx** - Version 3 of jungle navigation
- **JungleKidNav.tsx** - Kid-focused navigation component

## New Unified System

### Core Components
1. **JungleWordLibrary.tsx** - Main exploration page
2. **ExplorerShell.tsx** - Unified header and navigation
3. **CategoryGrid.tsx** & **CategoryTile.tsx** - Category selection
4. **WordCardUnified.tsx** - Single word card component
5. **RewardPopup.tsx** - Celebration system

### Key Improvements
- **Kid-First Design**: Front-facing action buttons (Say It, Need Practice, Master It)
- **Unified UX**: Single consistent experience across all age groups
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliant with reduced motion defaults
- **Performance**: Lazy loading and optimized animations
- **Rewards System**: Integrated gems, crowns, and celebration popups

### Design Principles
- Large tap targets (≥44px) for young children
- Auto-pronounce for ages 3-5
- Reduced motion by default
- High contrast mode support
- Screen reader announcements

## Builder.io Integration
All new components are registered in `builder-registrations.tsx` for CMS editing:
- Drag-and-drop word and category management
- Visual editing of difficulty levels and mascot emojis
- Age-appropriate content filtering

## Rollout Strategy
- **Phase 1**: Core ExplorerShell + CategoryGrid + WordCardUnified ✅
- **Phase 2**: Rewards System with celebration popups ✅
- **Phase 3**: Mini-games and AI recommendations (future)

## Migration Notes
- Route `/jungle-word-explorer` now uses `JungleWordLibrary`
- Old demo routes maintained for testing but deprecated
- User progress and settings preserved during transition
- Legacy localStorage keys migrated to unified format

## Architecture Benefits
- **Reduced Bundle Size**: Eliminated duplicate component logic
- **Easier Maintenance**: Single source of truth for word card UX
- **Consistent Experience**: Unified design system across all features
- **Enhanced Performance**: Optimized animations and lazy loading
- **Better Accessibility**: Centralized a11y features

## Restore Instructions
If legacy components need to be restored:
1. Copy files back to `client/components/`
2. Update imports in affected pages
3. Restore old routes in `App.tsx`
4. Note: User progress will remain compatible
