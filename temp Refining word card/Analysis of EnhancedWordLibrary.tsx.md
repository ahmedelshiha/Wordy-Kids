interface Word {
  id: number;
  word: string;
  pronunciation?: string;
  definition: string;
  example?: string;
  funFact?: string;
  emoji?: string;
  category: string;
  difficulty: "easy" | "medium" | "hard";
  imageUrl?: string;
  masteryLevel?: number;
  lastReviewed?: Date;
  nextReview?: Date;
}
```

## 3. Key Functionalities and Logic

### 3.1. Data Loading and Management

-   **Real-time Word Database Integration:** The component uses `useRealTimeWords()` hook to fetch words and categories. It falls back to a static `wordsDatabase` if real-time data is not available.
-   **`useEffect` for Word Updates:** A `useEffect` hook updates `currentWords` whenever `selectedCategory`, `realTimeWords`, or `lastUpdate` changes. It also initiates category session tracking via `CategoryCompletionTracker`.
-   **Manual Refresh:** The `handleRefresh` function allows users to manually refresh the word database, invalidating caches and providing haptic feedback on success.

### 3.2. Navigation and View Modes

-   **`viewMode` Control:** The `viewMode` state dictates which main section of the application is rendered: `EnhancedCategorySelector`, `EnhancedVocabularyBuilder`, or the word display area.
-   **`wordViewMode` Control:** Within the word display, `wordViewMode` switches between `grid`, `list`, and `carousel` layouts.
-   **Category Selection:** `handleCategorySelect` manages category switching, incorporating logic from `CategoryCompletionTracker` to prevent premature category changes if a session is locked. `performCategorySwitch` handles the actual state updates and haptic feedback.
-   **Word Navigation (Carousel View):** `handleWordNavigation` allows users to move between words in the carousel view, tracking word reviews as they navigate.

### 3.3. Search and Filtering

-   **`filteredWords`:** A computed array that filters `currentWords` based on `searchTerm` (matching word, definition, or category) and `difficultyFilter`.
-   **Search Input:** An `Input` component allows users to type search queries.
-   **Difficulty Filters:** Buttons for 


filtering by 'all', 'easy', 'medium', and 'hard' difficulty levels.

### 3.4. Word Actions

-   **Favorite and Bookmark:** `handleWordFavorite` and `handleWordBookmark` functions allow users to mark words as favorites or bookmarks. These preferences are stored in `localStorage`.
-   **Share Word:** `handleShareWord` utilizes the Web Share API to share word details. If not available, it falls back to copying the information to the clipboard.
-   **Pronunciation:** Integration with `audioService.pronounceWord` allows users to hear the pronunciation of words.

### 3.5. Accessibility and User Experience

-   **Mobile Responsiveness:** `useEffect` hook detects screen width to set `isMobile` and `isTablet` states, adjusting UI elements like the mobile header and controls.
-   **Accessibility Settings:** Users can toggle `highContrastMode`, `largeTextMode`, and `reducedMotion` for a personalized experience. These settings are persisted in `localStorage`.
-   **Auto-pronounce Words:** An `autoPlay` setting for automatic word pronunciation.
-   **Haptic Feedback:** Uses `navigator.vibrate` for subtle haptic feedback on certain interactions.
-   **Skip Link:** An `sr-only` (screen reader only) skip link is provided for accessibility.

### 3.6. Integration with Other Components and Services

`EnhancedWordLibrary` integrates with several external components and services:

-   **UI Components:** `Card`, `Button`, `Badge`, `Input`, `Progress` from `@/components/ui` provide the visual structure and interactive elements.
-   **Icon Library:** Various icons from `lucide-react` are used for visual cues.
-   **`JungleAdventureWordCard`:** Used to display individual word cards in grid and carousel views, handling word mastery tracking.
-   **`EnhancedCategorySelector`:** Manages category selection and display.
-   **`EnhancedVocabularyBuilder`:** Provides a dedicated interface for vocabulary practice.
-   **`CategoryCompletionPopup` and `CategoryLockWarning`:** Handle UI for category completion and warnings about locked categories.
-   **`wordsDatabase` and `getWordsByCategory`:** Static word data source.
-   **`audioService`:** Handles word pronunciation and sound effects.
-   **`useRealTimeWords` and `realTimeWordDB`:** Custom hooks and database for real-time word data.
-   **`cacheManager` and `refreshWordDatabase`:** For managing and refreshing cached word data.
-   **`CategoryCompletionTracker`:** A utility for tracking user progress within categories, including word reviews, time spent, and completion status. It also manages category locking and unlocking logic.

## 4. Code Structure and Best Practices

-   **Functional Components and Hooks:** The component is built using React functional components and leverages hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`, `useRef`) for state management and side effects.
-   **Modularity:** The component is well-structured, delegating specific functionalities to sub-components (e.g., `EnhancedCategorySelector`, `EnhancedVocabularyBuilder`, `JungleAdventureWordCard`).
-   **Accessibility (A11y):** Includes `aria-label` attributes for buttons and a skip link for screen readers, demonstrating a focus on accessibility.
-   **Responsiveness:** Uses Tailwind CSS classes (`md:`, `lg:`, `xl:`) and `window.innerWidth` checks to adapt the UI for different screen sizes.
-   **Local Storage:** Persists user preferences (favorites, bookmarks, accessibility settings) using `localStorage`.
-   **Error Handling:** Includes basic error logging for `handleRefresh` and `handleShareWord`.
-   **Haptic Feedback:** Enhances user experience on supported devices.

## 5. Potential Improvements and Considerations

-   **State Management Scalability:** For a much larger application, consider a more robust state management solution (e.g., Redux, Zustand, React Context API) to centralize and manage complex global states, especially with real-time data.
-   **Performance Optimization:** For very large word datasets, consider virtualization techniques (e.g., `react-window`, `react-virtualized`) for rendering lists to improve performance.
-   **Offline Support:** While `localStorage` is used for some preferences, a more comprehensive offline strategy (e.g., Service Workers, IndexedDB) could be implemented for full offline word browsing and learning.
-   **Testing:** Implement unit and integration tests for components and hooks to ensure reliability and prevent regressions.
-   **Theming:** While high contrast mode is available, a more comprehensive theming system could allow for greater customization.
-   **Internationalization (i18n):** If the application is intended for multiple languages, implement i18n for all text content.
-   **Server-Side Rendering (SSR) / Static Site Generation (SSG):** For improved initial load performance and SEO, consider SSR or SSG if the application content is largely static.
-   **Security:** If user data beyond local preferences is handled, ensure proper authentication, authorization, and data security measures are in place.

## 6. Conclusion

`EnhancedWordLibrary.tsx` is a well-designed and feature-rich React component that provides a comprehensive word learning experience. It demonstrates good practices in component-based architecture, state management, and user experience considerations, including responsiveness and accessibility. The integration with real-time data and category completion tracking adds significant value. With potential future enhancements in scalability, performance, and offline capabilities, this component could form the foundation of a robust educational application.
